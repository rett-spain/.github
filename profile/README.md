Welcome to the Rett Syndrome Spanish Association GitHub repository! Our NGO is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving the quality of life of people affected by Rett Syndrome in Spain.
Rett Syndrome is a rare neurological disorder that affects mainly females and causes severe physical and cognitive impairments.
The association provides information, support, and resources to affected individuals, their families, and caregivers, and also promotes research and awareness of the condition among the general public and healthcare professionals.
The AESR aims to ensure that people with Rett Syndrome receive the best possible care and support, and to work towards finding a cure for the disorder. This repository serves as a central location for our code and resources, and we welcome collaboration from others who share our passion for rare diseases.
